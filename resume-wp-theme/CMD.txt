Activate the theme in WordPress admin (Appearance > Themes)
Set up your blog page:
Create a page called "Blog"
Go to Settings > Reading
Set "Posts page" to your Blog page
Leave homepage blank to use front-page.php automatically
The homepage displays your portfolio sections (Experience, Skills, etc.), and the blog functionality is ready. All original assets, styles, and scripts are preserved and properly enqueued.
The theme is ready for personal use. You can add blog posts through the WordPress admin, and the homepage will continue to display your portfolio sections.
